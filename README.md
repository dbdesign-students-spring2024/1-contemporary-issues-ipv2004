# Data Breach at 23andMe Affects 6.9 Million Profiles, Company Says
23andMe is a company that allows people to submit DNA tests and get back information such as family history, predisposistion to certain diseases, and cultural background. They accomplish this with a comprehensive database of genetic makeups, allowing them to compare each new sample with millions of people's DNA. The technology is very contraversial, and has recently been in the news for a data breach affecting 6.9 million people.

## Article 1
In the LA Times' [Op-Ed: Take it from a genetic counselor: 23andMeâ€™s health reports are dangerously incomplete](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hopkins-23andme-genetic-testing-health-20181026-story.html), Sarah Hopkins asserts that although 23andMe can unveil potential genetic concerns such as predispositions for cancers, genetic diseases, and other disorders, the technology often amplifies anxieties rather than offering reassurance.
In her op-ed, Hopkins shares her personal background, highlighting her encounter with a specific gene that significantly elevates the risk of cancer. Seeking guidance from a genetic counselor, she eventually underwent organ removal and, through consistent counseling sessions, developed a comprehensive management plan for her condition.
Hopkins contends that 23andMe falls short in comparison to an actual genetic counselor, potentially causing more harm than good. Despite the company including contact information for the National Society of Genetic Counselors in its report, the provided information may be perplexing and distressing for individuals without specific biological knowledge.
Compounding these concerns, the inherent risks of having an evidently insecure database housing people's DNA make 23andMe a potentially precarious company. Utilizing their services could expose individuals to privacy breaches, presenting a significant threat to the security of their personal information. This article underscores the significance of not only possessing data but also recognizing the equal importance of having the tools necessary for its analysis.
## Article 2
However, in the Forbes Health review [23andMe Review](https://www.forbes.com/health/medical-supplies/23andme-review/#:~:text=While%2023andMe%20has%20a%20high,medical%20grade%20testing%2C%20explains%20Klee.), The article expresses a positive stance on 23andMe's technology, acknowledging Alyssa Northrop's argument that the company offers an Ancestry Report with remarkable specificity and compiles family trees for users. Additionally, it provides Health Reports identifying potential health risks and genetic predispositions for various traits.
Northrop suggests that 23andMe serves as a cost-effective alternative to genetic counseling, offering continuous updates for users who subscribe to the 23andMe + membership. She sees the company as a cultural phenomenon, fostering connections among individuals discovering shared genetic ancestry and sparking conversations about genetics' role in shaping identity.
While acknowledging privacy concerns, Northrop asserts that the benefits of the technology outweigh the risks. Despite the allure of the extensive database for potential biohackers, she argues that it is essential for meaningful individual result comparisons, underscoring the company's significance in genetic exploration and broader discussions about human genetics and ancestry.
